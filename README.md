# Pre-trained VGG16 + Model Performance  
In this Notebook we have done Image Classification using Tensorflow and after that we improved over accuracy using Pre-trained VGG16 Keras Application. 
We have plotted both accuracies and saw predictions : 
Also we have used Data Augmentation (Bcoz we had few examples) and also used Callbacks (Early stopping) to observe performance of model.. We can use Multiple callbacks like Checkpoints having accuracy condition and change Learningrates at every epochs :
